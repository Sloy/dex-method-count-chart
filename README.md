## WARNING: 
The idea of this repo was to create a gradle plugin that would create a interactive chart displaying the dex method count over libraries and classes of your apk.

Last time I used it, it was working. But the project hasn't been mantained or prepared for public usage. Use at your own risk. If you are interested on helping making it public, send me an email or open an Issue.
